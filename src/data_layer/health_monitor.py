"""
Data health monitor — continuous self-verification against external sources.

Cross-references the hub's live data against public exchange APIs (Binance spot,
premium index, long/short ratio) and checks per-feed freshness/staleness so the
terminal can *prove* its numbers rather than just display them.

Two consumers:
  - the hub runs ``run_checks()`` on an interval and caches the result, which the
    REST API (``/v1/health``) and the dashboard health badge read via ``latest()``
  - ``src/verify_data.py`` runs it once as a CLI for a manual integrity report

A check is one of:
  - "pass": value present and within tolerance
  - "warn": missing/degraded but not necessarily broken (e.g. sparse coverage)
  - "fail": actively wrong — a stale feed or a cross-reference outside tolerance
