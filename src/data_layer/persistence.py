    #       add smart_money_signals.wallet_confidence so a persisted
    #       smart/dumb label never travels without its sample-size confidence
    #   v4  drop the dead `wallets` table (only if empty): save_wallet /
    #       load_wallets had no production caller — SmartMoneyEngine keeps
    #       profiles in memory and recomputes them from fills — so the
